Scanner extracts features from a document.

Some scanners take the output of another scanner as input and generate new output.

For example, a typical token-oriented scanner often consists of a tokenizer, a normalizer, a token-related feature function (e.g., n-grams), and a post processor (e.g. bag of words, multibag of words).

A DC-Minhash scanner requires a bag or a multibag as its input. It generates a fix-sized list of minhash values.
